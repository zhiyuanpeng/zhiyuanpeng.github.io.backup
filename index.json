When I read this book, I meet many questions like why the potential function is defined on a clique. This post summiarizes my understanding of the representation of undirected graph model part in Koller/Friedman\u0026rsquo;s PGM book. I also brorrow some ideas from Micheal I. Jordan\u0026rsquo;s unfinished book An Introduction to Probabilistic Graphical Model 2 to explain why the potential function is defined on a clique.\nPrerequisites Some Important Concepts To understand this part in Koler/Friedman\u0026rsquo;s PGM book, we need first clarify some concepts:\n completeness: An axiom system is complete if all valid statements can be derived. soundness: An axiom system is sound if only valid statements can be derived. satisfiability: We say that a truth assignment $I$ satisfies a formula $\\varphi$ if $\\varphi[I]=\\mathrm{T} ;$ we write this as $I \\models \\varphi$. A formula $\\varphi$ is satisfiable if there exists a truth assignment $I$ such that $I \\models \\varphi$; otherwise $\\varphi$ is unsatisfiable. validity: A formula $\\varphi$ is valid (or a tautology) if for all a truth assignments $I, I \\models \\varphi$.  Proof of Exercise 2.5 In Koller/Friedman\u0026rsquo;s PGM book, the conclusion of exercise 2.5 is directly used to proof other theorems, so let\u0026rsquo;s do exercise 2.5 firstly.\nLet $X, Y, Z$ be three disjoint subsets of random variables. We say $X$ and $Y$ are conditionally independent given $Z$ if and only if\n$$ \\mathbb P_{X, Y \\mid Z}(x, y \\mid z)=\\mathbb P_{X \\mid Z}(x \\mid z) \\mathbb P_{Y \\mid Z}(y \\mid z) $$\nShow that $X$ and $Y$ are conditionally independent given $Z$ if and only if the joint distribution for the three subsets of random variables factors in the following form:\n$$ \\mathbb P_{X, Y, Z}(x, y, \\mid z)=h(x, z) g(y, z)) $$\nSolution:\nFist, we proof if $X$ and $Y$ are conditionally independent given $Z$, we can get $\\mathbb P_{X, Y, Z}(x, y, \\mid z)=h(x, z) g(y, z))$ as follows:\n$$ \\begin{aligned} \\mathbb P_{X, Y, Z}(x, y, z) \u0026amp;= \\mathbb P_{Z}(z) \\mathbb P_{X, Y | Z}(x, y | z) \\\\\n\u0026amp;=\\mathbb P_{Z}(z) \\mathbb P_{X | Z}(x | z) \\mathbb P_{Y | Z}(y | z) \\\\\n\u0026amp;=h(x, z) g(y, z) \\end{aligned} $$\nwhere we choose $h(x, z)=\\mathbb P_{X \\mid Z}(x \\mid z)$ and $g(y, z) = \\mathbb P_{Y \\mid Z}(y \\mid z) \\mathbb P_{Z}(z)$\nThen, we proof that if we can write $\\mathbb P_{X, Y, Z}(x, y, z)$ in this form: $h(x, z) g(y, z))$, we can get $\\mathbb P_{X, Y \\mid Z}(x, y \\mid z)=\\mathbb P_{X \\mid Z}(x \\mid z) \\mathbb P_{Y \\mid Z}(y \\mid z)$:\n$$ \\begin{aligned} \\mathbb P_{X, Y \\mid Z}(z, y \\mid z) \u0026amp;=\\frac{\\mathbb P_{X, Y, Z}(x, y, z)}{\\sum_{x, y} \\mathbb P_{X, Y, Z}(x, y, z)} \\\\\n\u0026amp;=\\frac{h(x, z) g(y, z)}{\\sum_{x, y} h(x, z) g(y, z)} \\\\\n\u0026amp;=\\frac{h(x, z)}{h_{1}(z)} \\frac{g(y, z)}{ g_{1}(z)} \\\\\n\u0026amp;=\\mathbb P_{X \\mid Z}(x \\mid z) \\mathbb P_{Y \\mid Z}(y \\mid z) \\end{aligned} $$\nWhy UDG is defined on cliques $A\u0026ndash;B\u0026ndash;C$\nFrom the graph above, we can get $A \\bot C \\mid B$, so, we don\u0026rsquo;t want $A$ and $C$ in the same potential function. Also, we notice that there is no edge connecting $A$ and $C$ directly. On the other side, if two nodes are connected, we should put them in one potential function. This is the intuition of why UDG is defined on cliques. Actually, if we define the UDG on cliques, we will not violate the independence assumptions induced by the network structure. Next we will explain it in detail.\nUDG independence We first copy some crucial definitions from Koller\u0026rsquo;s PGM book:\nDefinition 4.4:\nWe say that a distribution $P_{\\Phi}$ with $\\Phi=\\left{\\phi_{1}\\left(\\boldsymbol D_{1}\\right), \\ldots, \\phi_{K}\\left(\\boldsymbol D_{K}\\right)\\right}$ **factorizes** over a Markov network $\\mathcal{H}$ if each $\\boldsymbol{D}_{k}(k=1, \\ldots, K)$ is a complete subgraph of $\\mathcal{H}$.\nDefinition 4.8:\nLet $\\mathcal{H}$ be a Markov network structure, and let $X_{1}-\\ldots-X_{k}$ be a path in $\\mathcal{H}$. Let $\\boldsymbol{Z} \\subseteq \\mathcal{X}$ be a set of observed variables. The path $X_{1}-\\ldots-X_{k}$ is active given $\\boldsymbol{Z}$ if none of the $X_{i}$ \u0026rsquo;s, $i=1, \\ldots, k$, is in $Z$.\nDefinition 4.9:\nWe say that a set of nodes $\\boldsymbol{Z}$ separates $\\boldsymbol{X}$ and $\\boldsymbol{Y}$ in $\\mathcal{H}$, denoted $\\operatorname{sep}_{\\mathcal{H}}(\\boldsymbol{X} ; \\boldsymbol{Y} \\mid \\boldsymbol{Z})$, if there is no active path between any node $X \\in X$ and $Y \\in \\boldsymbol{Y}$ given $\\boldsymbol{Z}$. We define the global independencies associated with $\\mathcal{H}$ to be:\n$$ \\mathcal I(\\mathcal H)=\\left{(\\boldsymbol X \\perp \\boldsymbol Y \\mid \\boldsymbol Z): \\operatorname{sep}_{\\mathcal H}(\\boldsymbol X; \\boldsymbol Y \\mid \\boldsymbol Z)\\right} $$\n  Koller, D., \u0026amp; Friedman, N.
