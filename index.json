When I read chapter 4 of this book, I meet two questions: one is why the potential functions are defined on cliques, another is why the d-separation works. For the first question, I didn’t find a good answer from Koller/Friedman’s book, but, I found Micheal I. Jordan’s unfinished book An Introduction to Probabilistic Graphical Model [^4] gives some intuitions of why we do it like that. For the second one, Koller/Friedman’s book defines the d-separation in definition 4.9 and proves the soundness in theorem 4.1. When I first read theorem 4.1, I didn’t understand why the proof of theorem 4.1 could prove the soundness of definition 4.9. I got it after I read that part several times and I will share what I learned in this post.\nPrerequisites Some Important Concepts If you feel Koller/Friedman’s PGM difficult to digest, you may not familiar with some concepts, so, we first clarify some concepts that I did not know when I first read this book:\ncompleteness: An axiom system is complete if all valid statements can be derived. soundness: An axiom system is sound if only valid statements can be derived. satisfiability: We say that a truth assignment $I$ satisfies a formula $\\varphi$ if $\\varphi[I]=\\mathrm{T} ;$ we write this as $I \\models \\varphi$. A formula $\\varphi$ is satisfiable if there exists a truth assignment $I$ such that $I \\models \\varphi$; otherwise $\\varphi$ is unsatisfiable. validity: A formula $\\varphi$ is valid (or a tautology) if for all a truth assignments $I, I \\models \\varphi$. Proof of Exercise 2.5 In Koller/Friedman’s PGM book, the conclusion of exercise 2.5 is directly used to prove other theorems, but no proof is given. I googled this answer on the Internet, luckily, I found it and the proof is right in my view.\nExercise 2.5:\nLet $X, Y, Z$ be three disjoint subsets of random variables. We say $X$ and $Y$ are conditionally independent given $Z$ if and only if\n$$ \\mathbb P_{X, Y \\mid Z}(x, y \\mid z)=\\mathbb P_{X \\mid Z}(x \\mid z) \\mathbb P_{Y \\mid Z}(y \\mid z) $$\nShow that $X$ and $Y$ are conditionally independent given $Z$ if and only if the joint distribution for the three subsets of random variables factors in the following form:\n$$ \\mathbb P_{X, Y, Z}(x, y, \\mid z)=h(x, z) g(y, z)) $$\nSolution:\nFist, we proof if $X$ and $Y$ are conditionally independent given $Z$, we can get $\\mathbb P_{X, Y, Z}(x, y, \\mid z)=h(x, z) g(y, z))$ as follows:\n$$ \\begin{aligned} \\mathbb P_{X, Y, Z}(x, y, z) \u0026amp;= \\mathbb P_{Z}(z) \\mathbb P_{X, Y | Z}(x, y | z) \\\\ \u0026amp;=\\mathbb P_{Z}(z) \\mathbb P_{X | Z}(x | z) \\mathbb P_{Y | Z}(y | z) \\\\ \u0026amp;=h(x, z) g(y, z) \\end{aligned} $$\nwhere we choose $h(x, z)=\\mathbb P_{X \\mid Z}(x \\mid z)$ and $g(y, z) = \\mathbb P_{Y \\mid Z}(y \\mid z) \\mathbb P_{Z}(z)$\nThen, we proof that if we can write $\\mathbb P_{X, Y, Z}(x, y, z)$ in this form: $h(x, z) g(y, z))$, we can get $\\mathbb P_{X, Y \\mid Z}(x, y \\mid z)=\\mathbb P_{X \\mid Z}(x \\mid z) \\mathbb P_{Y \\mid Z}(y \\mid z)$:\n$$ \\begin{aligned} \\mathbb P_{X, Y \\mid Z}(z, y \\mid z) \u0026amp;=\\frac{\\mathbb P_{X, Y, Z}(x, y, z)}{\\sum_{x, y} \\mathbb P_{X, Y, Z}(x, y, z)} \\\\ \u0026amp;=\\frac{h(x, z) g(y, z)}{\\sum_{x, y} h(x, z) g(y, z)} \\\\ \u0026amp;=\\frac{h(x, z)}{h_{1}(z)} \\frac{g(y, z)}{ g_{1}(z)} \\\\ \u0026amp;=\\mathbb P_{X \\mid Z}(x \\mid z) \\mathbb P_{Y \\mid Z}(y \\mid z) \\end{aligned} $$\nDefinition 4.4 We say that a distribution factorizes over a Markov network $\\mathcal{H}$ if each $\\boldsymbol{D}_{k}(k=1, \\ldots, K)$ is a complete subgraph of $\\mathcal{H}$.\nGibbs Distribution A distribution $P_{\\Phi}$ is a Gibbs distribution parameterized by a set of factors $\\Phi=\\left\\{\\phi_{1}\\left(\\boldsymbol{D}_{1}\\right), \\ldots, \\phi_{K}\\left(\\boldsymbol{D}_{K}\\right)\\right\\}$ if it is defined as follows: $$ P_{\\Phi}\\left(X_{1}, \\ldots, X_{n}\\right)=\\frac{1}{Z} \\tilde{P}{\\Phi}\\left(X{1}, \\ldots, X_{n}\\right) $$ where $$ \\tilde{P}{\\Phi}\\left(X{1}, \\ldots, X_{n}\\right)=\\phi_{1}\\left(\\boldsymbol{D}{1}\\right) \\times \\phi{2}\\left(\\boldsymbol{D}{2}\\right) \\times \\cdots \\times \\phi{m}\\left(\\boldsymbol{D}{m}\\right) $$ is an unnormalized measure and $$ Z=\\sum{X_{.}} \\tilde{P}{\\Phi}\\left(X{1}, \\ldots, X_{n}\\right) $$\nIf we say a Gibbs distribution which factorizes over a Markov network, each factor in this Gibbs distribution is over a clique or complete subgraph.\nDefinition 4.8 Let $\\mathcal{H}$ be a Markov network structure, and let $X_{1}-\\ldots-X_{k}$ be a path in $\\mathcal{H}$. Let $\\boldsymbol{Z} \\subseteq \\mathcal{X}$ be a set of observed variables. The path $X_{1}-\\ldots-X_{k}$ is active given $\\boldsymbol{Z}$ if none of the $X_{i}$ ’s, $i=1, \\ldots, k$, is in $Z$.\nWhy UDG is defined on cliques? $A–B–C$\nFrom the graph above, we can get $A \\bot C \\mid B$, so, we don’t want $A$ and $C$ in the same potential function because they are independent if …","date":1620939570,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1620939570,"objectID":"4a48031afb62b8c5e4970b13b2d79af1","permalink":"https://zhiyuanpeng.github.io/post/representation-of-undirected-graph-models/","publishdate":"2021-05-13T13:59:30-07:00","relpermalink":"/post/representation-of-undirected-graph-models/","section":"post","summary":"Koller/Friedman’s book Probabilistic Graphical Models: Principles and Techniques 1 (PGM) is the most exhaustive book I have found for PGM, however, there are many definitions, theorems and mathematics within it which make the book hard to understand.","tags":["pgm"],"title":"Representation of Undirected Graph Models","type":"post"},{"authors":["zpeng"],"categories":[],"content":" PCB of the Weak Signal Detection Module ","date":1619325064,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1619325064,"objectID":"38cb7d9b7451d9b30c2ac27aa50858be","permalink":"https://zhiyuanpeng.github.io/project/electronic-position-detection-system/","publishdate":"2021-04-24T21:31:04-07:00","relpermalink":"/project/electronic-position-detection-system/","section":"project","summary":" PCB of the Weak Signal Detection Module ","tags":["EE"],"title":"Electronic Position Detection System","type":"project"},{"authors":["zpeng"],"categories":[],"content":" Head of Thermometer Tail of Thermometer Four Versions of the PCBs Communication with Monitor by Wireless Module ","date":1619325011,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1619325011,"objectID":"517ab66c171786e3e77aa03234ae8678","permalink":"https://zhiyuanpeng.github.io/project/non-contact-thermometer/","publishdate":"2021-04-24T21:30:11-07:00","relpermalink":"/project/non-contact-thermometer/","section":"project","summary":" Head of Thermometer Tail of Thermometer Four Versions of the PCBs Communication with Monitor by Wireless Module ","tags":["EE"],"title":"Non Contact Thermometer","type":"project"},{"authors":["zpeng"],"categories":[],"content":" UI 1 UI 2 Car 1 Car 2 Car on the Race ","date":1619324966,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1619324966,"objectID":"e9e4d84241af215c2a24fac1acbd14c6","permalink":"https://zhiyuanpeng.github.io/project/intelligent-car-based-on-electromagnetic-sensors/","publishdate":"2021-04-24T21:29:26-07:00","relpermalink":"/project/intelligent-car-based-on-electromagnetic-sensors/","section":"project","summary":" UI 1 UI 2 Car 1 Car 2 Car on the Race ","tags":["EE"],"title":"Intelligent Car Based on Electromagnetic Sensors","type":"project"},{"authors":["zpeng"],"categories":[],"content":" Ready to Go!

Therefore, in this letter, we propose an open-loop adaptive filter based on the reiterative minimum mean-square error for the acquisition of CDMA signals. The method is based on the existing multistatic adaptive pulse compression method, appropriately adapted to the characteristics of CDMA continuous-wave signals. The efficacy of the proposed method in such systems is verified by simulation, and its superiority when compared with the existing least-mean-square method in terms of the number of reiterations is established.","tags":[""],"title":"Multiple-Access Interference Mitigation for Acquisition of Code-Division Multiple-Access Continuous-Wave Signals","type":"publication"},{"authors":["S.

To test and verify the measurement performance of TT\u0026C systems, a signal simulator is required for development and testing to accurately simulate the high dynamic characteristics of the signal. In this paper, a signal simulation method based on Lagrange interpolation is proposed to solve the phase jitter caused by phase compensation in the traditional methods during high precision signal simulation. The method is implemented by a polyphase structure with a low complexity. Theoretical analysis and simulation results show that the method has improved precision of signal simulation and reduced algorithm complexity.","tags":[""],"title":"High-Precision TT C signal simulation technology based on lagrange interpolation in high dynamic environment","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"f26b5133c34eec1aa0a09390a36c2ade","permalink":"https://zhiyuanpeng.github.io/admin/config.yml","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/admin/config.yml","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"wowchemycms"}]
