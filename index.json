Therefore, in this letter, we propose an open-loop adaptive filter based on the reiterative minimum mean-square error for the acquisition of CDMA signals. The method is based on the existing multistatic adaptive pulse compression method, appropriately adapted to the characteristics of CDMA continuous-wave signals. The efficacy of the proposed method in such systems is verified by simulation, and its superiority when compared with the existing least-mean-square method in terms of the number of reiterations is established.","tags":[""],"title":"Multiple-Access Interference Mitigation for Acquisition of Code-Division Multiple-Access Continuous-Wave Signals","type":"publication"},{"authors":["S.

To test and verify the measurement performance of TT\u0026C systems, a signal simulator is required for development and testing to accurately simulate the high dynamic characteristics of the signal. In this paper, a signal simulation method based on Lagrange interpolation is proposed to solve the phase jitter caused by phase compensation in the traditional methods during high precision signal simulation. The method is implemented by a polyphase structure with a low complexity. Theoretical analysis and simulation results show that the method has improved precision of signal simulation and reduced algorithm complexity.","tags":[""],"title":"High-Precision TT C signal simulation technology based on lagrange interpolation in high dynamic environment","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"f26b5133c34eec1aa0a09390a36c2ade","permalink":"https://zhiyuanpeng.github.io/admin/config.yml","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/admin/config.yml","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"wowchemycms"}]
