 abstract = {High-precision simulation of the signal in a high dynamic environment is a research hotspot in the field of space telemetry, track and command (TT&C). To test and verify the measurement performance of TT&C systems, a signal simulator is required for development and testing to accurately simulate the high dynamic characteristics of the signal. In this paper, a signal simulation method based on Lagrange interpolation is proposed to solve the phase jitter caused by phase compensation in the traditional methods during high precision signal simulation. The method is implemented by a polyphase structure with a low complexity. Theoretical analysis and simulation results show that the method has improved precision of signal simulation and reduced algorithm complexity.},
